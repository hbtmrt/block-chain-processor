# Blockchain event stream processor
## Demonstration
[![](https://github.com/hbtmrt/block-chain-processor/blob/main/blockchain-demo.gif)](https://github.com/hbtmrt/block-chain-processor/blob/main/blockchain-demo.gif)

## Project Structure
- BlockChainProcessor.App - This project contains the main logic of the program.
- BlockChianProcessor.Core - This project contains the core logic files that can be sharable across the solution.
## Extensibility
- ILogger
This program has only ConsoleLogger. But the program can add more loggers in the future. We need to extend from ILogger class and implement the Write method. Then we need to do a tiny modification to the LoggerFactory class to add a new instance of the new class.

- ICommandProcessor
  - This program has few command processors to handle each command type, namely, 
  - ReadLineCommandProcessor: handles --read-inline requests
  - ReadFileCommandProcessor: handles --read-file requests
  - NftOwnershipCommandProcessor - handles NFT commands
  - WalletOwnershipCommandProcessor - handles wallet commands
  - ResetCommandProcessor - handles reset command.
  - New commands can be easily added by extending ICommandProcessor.

- ITransactionExcecutor
  - This program has a few transaction types
  - Mint - Adding blocks to the wallet
  - Burn - remove the block
  - Transfer - Remove block from the wallet and add it to another.
  - New transaction types can be easily added by extending ITransactionExcecutor

## Assumptions
- The program requires the following format to execute commands.
"program - -reset"
  - "program" keyword is required.
  - "--" before every command
  - Some test results given in the test document are most likely to be wrong; therefore, I made that assumption and continued the development
Ex:

## Special Notes
- The following command given in the test document will not be excecuted as it is not valid. (-nft should be - -nft)program -nft 0xC000000000000000000000000000000000000000
- This project has used the Factory method pattern to create objects in one place.
- And also, this project used the strategy pattern for future implementation.
- And singleton pattern also has been used for some classes to make sure it creates only one instance throughout the project.
- Some custom exception class has been added to handle specific errors.
- I have added GitHub action to make sure everything is building for each commit.
- Only one instance can be created from the application to prevent unnecessary operation.

## Commands
- All the commands in the test documentation are supported.
